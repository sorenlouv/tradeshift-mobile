=================

Lets be honest - invoicing sucks and no sane person wants to do it. The only reason we still have invoices today is because no one bothered to break out of the restrictions introduced years ago by this legacy format called paper. And we're kinda past that now, so lets just move on and we can all forget about the craziness of invoices, credit notes, purchase orders, remittance advice and other concepts we really don't want to take up space in our heads.   We will be building a mobile first application that automates all the legal requirements around invoicing (using tradeshifts public api), based on sensible, structured human-to-human communication.
